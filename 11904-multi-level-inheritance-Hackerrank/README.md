We highly recommend solving Inheritance-Introduction before solving this problem.</em></p>

<p>In the previous problem, we learned about inheritance and how can a derived class object use the member functions of the base class.</p>

<p>In this challenge, we explore multi-level inheritance. Suppose, we have a class A which is the base class and we have a class B which is derived from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access the functions of both class A and class B by creating an object for class C. Hence, this mechanism is called <em>multi-level inheritance</em>. (B inherits A and C inherits B.)</p>

<p>Create a class called <em>Equilateral</em> which inherits from <em>Isosceles</em> and should have a function such that the output is as given below.</p></div></div></div><div class="challenge_sample_output"><div class="msB challenge_sample_output_title"><p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p></div><div class="msB challenge_sample_output_body"><div class="hackdown-content"><svg style="display: none;"><defs id="MathJax_SVG_glyphs"></defs></svg><pre><code>I am an equilateral triangle
